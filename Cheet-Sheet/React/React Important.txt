JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.

A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.
For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button

.External JavaScript Advantages
Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:

It separates HTML and code
It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads

.External References
An external script can be referenced in 3 different ways:

With a full URL (a full web address)
With a file path (like /js/)
Without any path

.JavaScript Display Possibilities
JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

Writing into an HTML element,using innerHTML.
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

.JavaScript Keywords
JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

var	Declares a variable
let	Declares a block variable
const	Declares a block constant
if	Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition
switch	Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases
for	Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop
function	Declares a function
return	Exits a function
try	Implements error handling to a block of statements

..JavaScript Values
The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

Fixed values
Variable values

Fixed values are called Literals.
Variable values are called Variables.

..JavaScript Variables
In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.
JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.
An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

..Variables are Containers for Storing Data
..The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
..The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
..The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.


...Arrow Fuction
Arro Function allows us to write shorter Function syntex

...UseMemo
UseMemo Is Provide stop Unwanted Function Calling

...Hooks
Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.
...useState: Manage state in functional components
...useEffect: Manage side effects like API calls, subscriptions, timers, etc.
...useContext: Access the current context value
...useReducer: An alternative to useState for complex state management
...useCallback, useMemo: Performance optimization Hooks 


The useCallback and useMemo Hooks are similar.
